# aiCar
A short program displaying AI concepts applied to two 2D cars. The cars are able to flee, pursue, arrive and follow the track
using the A* algorithm. This project taught me a lot about state machines and pathfinding algorithms and how these can be 
used to create believable AI. A video of the project can be found at https://youtu.be/d2qlDTe0G0w.
